## Question 1:

Image 1.1 shows three PCs connected to 2096 swicth. The PCs are set with the IP addresses 192.168.1.1, 2 and 3 respectively with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
A ping is sent from PC1 to PC2. The packets reach the intended destination and network with multiple devices is simulated. 

Image 1.2 shows the MAC address table of Switch0 using the command "show mac address-table" in the CLI of Swicth0. 

Image 1.3 shows the source and destination MAC addresses of packet that is sent. It also tells the type of protocol used for this transmission.
