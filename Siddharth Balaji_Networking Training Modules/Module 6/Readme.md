## Q1

ARP is at Data Link layer and is used to reslove IP address to MAC address in the local network.

ARP frames are of two types: Requests and Replies.

Request: Sent by a device to verify whether its IP address is avaiable and gather the MAC address. This is a broadcast.

Who has 192.168.0.105? Tell 192.168.0.1 (router) . The router will now reply with who has that IP.

Reply: It is an acknowldgement and shares its MAC address. This is a unicast.

192.168.0.103 is at 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 MAC address.
