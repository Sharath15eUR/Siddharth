Q7. How to check your default gateway is reachable or not and understand about default gateway.

sidhu@sidhu:~$ ip route | grep default
default via 10.0.2.2 dev enp0s3 proto dhcp src 10.0.2.15 metric 100 
sidhu@sidhu:~$ ping -c 4 10.0.2.2

The default gateway is the router's IP address that connects your local network to other networks.
When a computer doesnâ€™t know where to send a packet, it forwards it to the default gateway.

10.0.2.2 is the default gateway 

enp0s3 is the network interface used.
