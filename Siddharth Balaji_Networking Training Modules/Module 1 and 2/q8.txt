Q8: Check iwconfig/ifconfig to understand in detail about network interfaces.

ifconifg:  

It is used to display and configure the network interfaces.

eth0, wlan0: Interface name that dentifies the network adapter.
inet: IPv4 address is the IP assigned to the interface.
netmask: Shows the subnet mask.
broadcast: Broadcast address for the network.
ether (MAC address): Unique hardware address.
RX and TX packets & bytes: Shows data sent and received.
flags (e.g., UP, BROADCAST, RUNNING):  Status indicators.


iwconfig:

It is used to display and configure the wireless network interfaces.

sidhu@sidhu:~$ iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

enp0s3    no wireless extensions.

Although wirelesss connections are not displayed here, following are the common parameters
displayed.

Interface name (wlan0): Wireless network adapter.
ESSID: Connected Wi-Fi network name.
Mode: Managed (Client mode), Ad-Hoc (Peer-to-peer), Monitor (Packet sniffing).
Frequency: Wi-Fi channel frequency.
Access Point (AP MAC Address): MAC of the router connected.
Bit Rate: Current data transmission speed.
Tx-Power: Signal transmission power in dBm.
Signal Level: Higher is better (closer to 0 dBm).
Noise Level: Lower is better (further from 0 dBm).
