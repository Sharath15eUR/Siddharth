Q10: Explain how a DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices in your network.

Dynamic Host COnifguration Protocol uses what is called a DORA process.

DORA stands for:
> DHCP Discover
> DHCP Offer
> DHCP Requst 
> DHCP Acknowledge

1. DHCP Discover:
Client sends discover message as a broadcast to find an available DHCP server.

2. DHCP Offer:
DHCP server will respond with a DHCP Offer which gives an available IP addresss from its IP pool.
This includes a subnet mask, default gateway, and the duration for which the IP is valid.

3. DHCP Request:
The client selects one of the available/offered IPs and sends a DHCP request his/her choice.

4. DHCP Acknowledgement:
DHCP sens a DHCP Ack(Acknowledgement) to confirm that the IP is taken up by this particular client
and prevents other clients from getting this IP assigned.
