Wireshark is a general packet captruing tool. So, a user must use Wireshark with a goal-oriented approach.
It can be used to understand which two elements on the network are sharing information, to understand
if somebody is undergoing a phishing attack or learn general statistics about the network. 

There are general filtering methods like Right-CLick Filtering which will has options like
1. Apply as filter
2. Prepare as filter
3. Find
4. Colourise
5. Coopy Conversation Table
6. REsize all columns to content. 

The others are as follows:

CAPTURE FILTERS:
Applied before packet capture to limit what is recorded.
It is more efficient as unwanted packets are never captured.

Example filters:
host 192.168.1.1 : Captures packets to/from this IP.
port 80 : Captures only HTTP traffic.
tcp or udp : Captures only TCP and UDP packets.
net 192.168.1.0/24 : Captures traffic from a subnet.


DISPLAY FILTERS:
Applied after packet capture to refine displayed packets.

Example filters:
ip.src == 192.168.1.1 : Shows packets from this IP.
ip.dst == 10.0.0.1  : Shows packets going to this IP.
tcp.flags.syn == 1 : Displays only SYN packets.
http : Displays only HTTP traffic.
dns && udp : Displays only DNS queries and responses.


COLOUR FILTERS:
Helps visually differentiate packet types using colors.

Example:
Red : Errors (TCP retransmissions).
Green : Successful HTTP responses.
Blue : DNS traffic.

CISCO PACKET TRACER:

It is a tool that enables us to visualise networks.
We can add or remove a variety of elements that can be used in a network.

We can simulate how a packet will typically move in a network involving various components.
It can also be used to verify if a component is even able to send/recieve a packet

We can filter packets by: 
1. Allowing packets only from specific IP address
2. Allow specific hosts to access the network.
3. Filter packest based on protocol like TCP, UDP, ICMP
4. Filter based on web traffic like HTTP and HTTPS.
