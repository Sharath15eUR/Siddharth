Q5: Understand what happens when duplicate IPs are configured in a network?

-> This situation creates an IP conflict.

This leads to the following problems:
> Network disruptions
>Loss of connectivity
>Security issues
>Error messages

The solution to this problem is using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
It automatically assigns unique IP addresses to devices. It dynamically reallocates addresses when
devices disconnect or reconnect.
